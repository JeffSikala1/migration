17-Nov-2025 13:26:20	Bamboo YAML import failed: Document structure is incorrect: Found following unused properties: Build_And_Push / tasks / [5] / script / executable.
17-Nov-2025 13:26:20	Every property must have a correct key recognizable by Bamboo and must be used as part of the configuration in the current YAML document. Common sources of these problems are typos in properties keys, unused jobs, and mixing a plan and its permissions configuration in one YAML document.
