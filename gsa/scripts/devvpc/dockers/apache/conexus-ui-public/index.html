        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          GSA Conexus can streamline and simplify complex agency purchasing transactions as they relate to telecom
          ordering management. It provides a single, easy-to-use dynamic system that encompasses agency funding,
          ordering, billing, inventory,
          reporting and data analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conexus can both house vital agency data and protect it through robust security protocols and individual
          role-based permissions. User permissions are not governed by GSA itself, but rather by each individual
          agency. This ability gives
          agencies the flexibility to control and share as much or as little data as they wish within their own
          organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conexus also has systematic data feeds between awarded vendors and the application ensuring that Conexus has
          the most recent and up-to-date information, whether it be order statuses, billing information and dispute
          recommendations, or
          provisioning and billing Service Level Agreement (SLA) performance metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conexus - Your link to a simplified and more efficient way to manage your telecommunication services
          purchasing business.

          <ul>
            <li>
              View direct orders (orders placed directly with contractors). Even if agencies choose to place Service
              Orders (SOs) to contractors outside of the Conexus system, EIS contractors are required to send
              systematic data feeds including
              ordering and billing information to the Conexus system. In this manner, Conexus captures agency order
              information. Conexus also assumes that the contractor information is accurate in this scenario, and if
              not, agencies need to work
              directly with the contractor for correction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create, submit and track status of pass-through orders (orders generated in Conexus and passed to
              contractors). One of the key benefits of using Conexus to place SOs to vendors is that Conexus will be
              able to accurately validate
              subsequent billing and inventory data to ordering information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create multiple types of orders such as Install, Supplement, Cancel, Change, and Disconnect orders.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Install:</b> An order for a new service.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Supplement:</b> An order that is supplemental to another order that can change certain criteria (can
              only be submitted against an open order, not one that has already been completed by the contractor).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cancel:</b> An order that cancels an open order.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Change:</b> An order that modifies delivered service in some manner:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Change:</b> Modifies service details after an initial order has been completed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Change/Inside Move:</b> Changes the service location within the same building after initial
                  delivery.

                <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Disconnect:</b> An order to remove service that has been delivered and to stop the billing.

              Create and manage AHCs to represent the agency where these costs are grouped based on agency accounting
              codes and/or reporting requirements. AHCs are 28-digit codes used by agencies to keep track of which
              bureaus, sub-bureaus, offices
              or departments are financially responsible for incurring the cost of specific telecommunication services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Registering AHCs in Conexus is a benefit to agencies as EIS vendor data including Service Order
              Completion Notices and billing information is passed to Conexus. Conexus will validate whether the AHCs
              in vendor data are found within the
              Conexus system. If an AHC has been registered in Conexus, it is considered valid. If it is not found in
              Conexus (not registered), it will be flagged as “unregistered” to give agencies an opportunity to
              determine if the
              contractor-provided AHC information is valid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accounts Payable (AP) Funding Input and AHC Linking - Agencies can opt to enter their funding data such
              as Lines of Accounting LOAs into Conexus. This funding data can then be linked to registered AHCs. This
              linking will provide
              agencies with a clear and concise way to link funding to ordering to billing and credits.
